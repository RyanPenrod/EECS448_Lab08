      Hello, I am dog. I am 8" tall and a big fan of walking, barking and eating.<br>
      My accomplishments include: being extremely handsome and being the best boy in the whole world.<br>
      I have many friends, they include mom, dad and cat.<br>
      Except, cat is not my friend. Cat is my enemy.<br>
      Cat is very mean and does not deserve to stay inside, cat should sleep in dog house :(<br>
